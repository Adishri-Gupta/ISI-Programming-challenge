Tools and Libraries used-

nltk==3.2.5
pandas==1.3.5
requests==2.27.1
textblob==0.15.3

#First Method 
TEXTBLOB-
TextBlob is a python library for Natural Language Processing (NLP).TextBlob actively used Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) to achieve its tasks.
TextBlob returns polarity and subjectivity of a sentence. Polarity lies between [-1,1], -1 defines a negative sentiment and 1 defines a positive sentiment.


#Second Method
VADER sentiment-
VADER means Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner.VADER utilizes a mix of lexical highlights (e.g., words) that are, for the most part, marked by their semantic direction as one or the other positive or negative. Thus, VADER not only tells about the Polarity score yet, in addition, it tells us concerning how positive or negative a conclusion is.

#Third Method
FLAIR-
Flair delivers state-of-the-art performance in solving NLP problems such as named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech tagging (PoS), sense disambiguation and text classification.
